I'm a final year PhD. student part of the [LogiCS doctoral program](https://logic-cs.at/phd/) funded by the Austrian Science Fund (FWF).
My research is motivated by the unprecedented advances in combinatorial solving techniques over the past three decades, often called the SAT-revolution. 
Inspired by an enormous success in the area of SAT solving,
we incite to solve problems that go beyond SAT.

My Ph.D work focus on a fragment of Boolean Logic with quantifiers known as (D)-QBFs.
These formulas can compactly encode reasoning tasks in artificial intelligence including planning, two-player games, bounded model checking and systems biology.
